Socks should be worn first on the toe, and then evenly pull the sock over
the  entire foot. At the same time , special attention should be paid 
to heel of the sock should be worn on the geel of the foot and should not
move in any direction. It is better to wear socks correctly by rolling
them up to the nose and thes ass a condom already on the whole leg and pull
it on , this is the faster and most convenient way of putting on and there 
is no risk of pulling it by the sock to tear or damage it somehow!
